# Wani-et-al-OAE-Carbon-Partioning
Repository for data used to create figures in submitted manuscript Wani et al. "The Impact of NaOH, CaO, and HCO3- + Ca+2 Addition on PIC and POC Formation in Los Angeles Harbor Waters". 
This data will be uploaded to Zenodo once manuscript has been accepted for publication. 

***Main Text Figures:***

Data used to create Figure 2 and Figure 4 can be found in file - "altasea-all-summary-datasheet_carb.csv"

Data used to create Figure 3 and Figure 5 can be found in file - "altasea-all-summary_light.csv"

Data used to create Figure 6 can be found in file - "isotopes_norm_dic.csv"

Data used to create Figure 7 can be found in file - "carbon_budget_altasea.csv"

Data used to create Figure 8a and 8b can be found in file - "oxygen_poc_crossplot.csv"


***Supplemental Figures:***

Data used to create Figure S1 and Figure S2 can be found in in file - "altasea-all-summary-datasheet_dark.csv".

All averages and standard deviations were created using a data_summary function as detailed in the manuscript main text Section 2.6 Data Visualization and Statistical Analysis. 
Data creation from sample collection and processing is also detailed in Section 2 of the manuscript main text.


***Abbreviations Used in Datasheets*** 
Data is organized by discreet bottle samples, and is organized by the Experiment Number, Light Shading Treatment, Sample ID/Bottle ID, Time point of Sampling within the Experiment and Alkalinity Treatment.

"EXP_no" is the Experiment Number.

"Treatment1" is either Light or Dark Shading

"Treatment2" is either the Control sample or the type of alkalinity received. 

"Experiment_Day" is Sampling Day

"PIC" Particulate Inorganic Carbon (Units: microgram per L)

"PIC_rsd" Particulate Inorganic Carbon Relative Standard Deviation  (Units: microgram per L)

"POC" Particulate Organic Carbon  (Units: microgram per L)

"POC_rsd" Particulate Organic Carbon Relative Standard Deviation (Units: microgram per L)

"DIC" Dissolved Inorganic Carbon in  (Units: micromol per kg)

"DI_13C" Delta 13C of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (Units: per mil)

"norm_dic_iso" Delta 13C of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon normalized to the Day-0 value of that experiment's respective Control or Treatment Value.

"ALK" Alkalinity (Units: micromol per kg)

"DOC" Dissolved Organic Carbon (Units: micromol per kg)

"DOC_sd" Dissolved Organic Carbon Standard Deviation (Units: micromol per kg)

"CHL" Chlorophyll a (Units: microgram per L)

"O2" Dissolved Oxygen (Units: micromol per kg)

"temp_out" Sea Surface Temperature during Incubation

"pressure_out" Pressure during Incubation

The following are standard outputs of CO2Sys.v3 with Error that have included alongside discreet bottle datapoints. Theese were calculated from the TA and DIC pair as detailed in the manuscript main text. "pH_out",	"H_out", "fCO2_out",	"pCO2_out",	"HCO3",	"CO3",	"CO2",	"B_Alk", 	"OH-out",	"P_Alk",	"Si_Alk",	"Revelle_out",	"ar_omega",	"dry_CO2",	"ER_pH_out", "ER_H_out",	"ER_fCO2_out",	"ER_pCO2_out",	"ER_HCO3,	"ER_CO3,	"ER_CO2",	"ER_B_Alk",	"ER_OH-out",	"ER_P_Alk",	"ER_Si_Alk",	"ER_Revelle_out",	"ER_ar_omega",	"ER_dry_CO2"

***For Figure 8a and 8b, file "oxygen_poc_crossplot.csv".*** All Deltas are calculated as the Day 4 - Day 0 value for the variables: dissolved oxygen, measured POC, and measured DIC.

"d_mO2" Delta Measured Dissolved Oxygen (Units: micromol per kg)

"d_mO2_er" Delta Measured Dissolved Oxygen Error (Units: micromol per kg)

"d_mPOC" Delta Measured Particulate Organic Carbon (Units: micromol per kg)

"d_mPOC_er" Delta Measured Particulate Organic Carbon Error (Units: micromol per kg)

"d_dic" Delta Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (Units: micromol per kg)

"d_dic_er" Delta Dissolved Inorganic Carbon Error (Units: micromol per kg)
